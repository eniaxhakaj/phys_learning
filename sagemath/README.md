# Sage

Computer Algebra System.

See [Sage for undergrads](http://www.gregorybard.com/sage_for_undergraduates_color.pdf.zip)

Getting sage to run can be a bit of a pain. It is in the Fedora repositories but I needed to follow https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1464520 to install some extra deps.

The default colors are also hard to read on a black terminal. See https://ask.sagemath.org/question/10060/sage-terminal-colors/.
